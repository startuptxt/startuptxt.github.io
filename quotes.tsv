Every business is a monarchy with, not a man, but an idea as king.	Henry Ford

You don’t have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time.	Charlie Munger
Spend less than you make; always be saving something. Put it into a tax-deferred account. Over time, it will begin to amount to something. This is such a no-brainer.	Charlie Munger
Choose clients as you would friends.	Charlie Munger

The thing is, it’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better.	Jonathan Ive
So what makes me happy? I was really happy to build this house. That’s it; building things. The trouble with software is that it’s very hard to show your aunt in Florida what you’ve done.	Larry Ellison
I love sailing. I like it more when I am winning.	Larry Ellison
I think about the business all the time. Well I shouldn’t say all the time. I don’t think about it when I am wakeboarding. But even when I am on vacation, or on my boat; I am on email everyday. I am always prowling around the internet looking at what our competitors are doing.	Larry Ellison
The only way to get ahead is to find errors in conventional wisdom.	Larry Ellison
You have to act and act now.	Larry Ellison
Being first is more important to me. I have so much money. Whatever money is, it’s just a method of keeping score now. I mean, I certainly don’t need more money.	Larry Ellison
Building Oracle is like doing math puzzles as a kid.	Larry Ellison
Software is all about scale. The larger you are, the more profitable you are. If we sell twice as much as software, it doesn’t cost us twice as much to build that software. So the more customers you have, the more scale you have. The larger you are, the more profitable you are.	Larry Ellison
All you can do is every day, try to solve a problem and make your company better.	Larry Ellison
The most important aspect of my personality, as far as determining my success goes, has been my questioning conventional wisdom, doubting the experts and questioning authority.	Larry Ellison
If your cash is about to run out you have to cut your cash flow.	Larry Ellison

When you innovate, you’ve got to be prepared for everyone telling you you’re nuts.	Larry Ellison

We are here to win. Winning, that’s my idea of fun.	Larry Ellison
Great achievers are driven, not so much by the pursuit of success, but by the fear of failure.	Larry Ellison
The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion.	Larry Ellison
When I started Oracle, what I wanted to do was to create an environment where I would enjoy working. That was my primary goal. Sure, I wanted to make a living. I certainly never expected to become rich, certainly not this rich. I mean, rich does not even describe this. This is surreal.	Larry Ellison
I enjoy the competition and the process of learning as we compete. The whole thing is just fascinating. I don’t know what I’ll do when I retire. When I go sailing, I look around … anyone want to race? I just love competing as opposed to just going out and watching the sunset.	Larry Ellison
A relationship is like a shark, it either has to move forward or it dies. And that’s true about your company.	Larry Ellison
With the right mentor, don’t be afraid to expose your vulnerabilities. Admit you don’t know what you don’t know. When you acknowledge your weaknesses and ask for advice, you’ll be surprised how much others will help.	Howard Schultz
Work should be personal. For all of us. Not just for the artist and entrepreneur. Work should have meaning for the accountant, the construction worker, the technologist, the manager and the clerk.	Howard Schultz
If you examine a butterfly according to the laws of aerodynamics, it shouldn’t be able to fly. But the butterfly doesn’t know that, so it flies.	Howard Schultz
My passion. My commitment. This is the most important thing in my life other than my family.	Howard Schultz
Remember: You’ll be left with an empty feeling if you hit the finish line alone. When you run a race as a team, though, you’ll discover that much of the reward comes from hitting the tape together. You want to be surrounded not just by cheering onlookers but by a crowd of winners, celebrating as one.	Howard Schultz
One of the fundamental aspects of leadership, I realized more and more, is the ability to instill confidence in others when you yourself are feeling insecure.	Howard Schultz
We have no patent on anything we do and anything we do can be copied by anyone else. But you can’t copy the heart and the soul and the conscience of the company.	Howard Schultz
In times of adversity and change, we really discover who we are and what we’re made of.	Howard Schultz
Whatever you do, don’t play it safe. Don’t do things the way they’ve always been done. Don’t try to fit the system. If you do what’s expected of you, you’ll never accomplish more than others expect.	Howard Schultz
At a certain stage in a company’s development, an entrepreneur has to develop into a professional manager. That often goes against the grain.	Howard Schultz
Treat people like family, and they will be loyal and give their all. Stand by people, and they will stand by you.	Howard Schultz
Whatever your culture, your values, your guiding principles, you have to take steps to inculcate them in the organization early in its life so that they can guide every decision, every hire, every strategic objective you set.	Howard Schultz
But when you really believe—in yourself, in your dream—you just have to do everything you possibly can to take control and make your vision a reality. No great achievement happens by luck.	Howard Schultz
Growth should not be — and is not — a strategy; it’s a tactic.	Howard Schultz
I think the leader today has to demonstrate both transparency and vulnerability, and with that comes truthfulness and humility and obviously the ability to instill confidence in people, and not through some top-down hierarchical approach.	Howard Schultz
If you want to build a great enterprise, you have to have the courage to dream great dreams. If you dream small dreams, you may succeed in building something small. For many people, that is enough. But if you want to achieve widespread impact and lasting value, be bold.	Howard Schultz
For all the promise of digital media to bring people together, I still believe that the most sincere, lasting powers of human connection come from looking directly into someone else’s eyes, with no screen in between.	Howard Schultz
I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It’s seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It’s seeing what other people don’t see and pursuing that vision.	Howard Schultz
Early on I realized that I had to hire people smarter and more qualified than I was in a number of different fields, and I had to let go of a lot of decision-making. I can’t tell you how hard that is. But if you’ve imprinted your values on the people around you, you can dare to trust them to make the right moves.	Howard Schultz
In this ever-changing society, the most powerful and enduring brands are built from the heart. They are real and sustainable. Their foundations are stronger because they are built with the strength of the human spirit, not an ad campaign. The companies that are lasting are those that are authentic.	Howard Schultz
You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.	Walt Disney
Start before you’re ready. Good things happen when we start before we’re ready.	Steven Pressfield
Don’t think. Act.	Steven Pressfield
Don’t Prepare. Begin.	Steven Pressfield
The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preoccupation with the mystery. The professional shuts up. She doesn’t talk about it. She does her work.	Steven Pressfield
The professional has learned that success, like happiness, comes as a by-product of work. The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like.	Steven Pressfield
Of any activity you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it?	Steven Pressfield
It’s better to be in the arena, getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the stands or out in the parking lot.	Steven Pressfield
This is the other secret that real artists know and wannabe writers don’t. When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. The Muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.	Steven Pressfield
The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.	Steven Pressfield
We must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or attention or applause.	Steven Pressfield
Are you paralyzed with fear? That’s a good sign. Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator. Fear tells us what we have to do. Remember one rule of thumb: the more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it.	Steven Pressfield
How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.	Anne Frank
Question everything generally thought to be obvious.	Dieter Rams
I hate everything that is driven by fashion. From the beginning it was hating the sixties American way of styling. Especially the cars. They changed their styling every two years to sell new ones. Which has nothing to do with good design.	Dieter Rams
Design should not dominate things, should not dominate people. It should help people. That’s its role.	Dieter Rams
All too much of the man-made is ugly, inefficient, depressing chaos.	Dieter Rams
One of the most significant design principles is to omit the unimportant in order to emphasize the important.	Dieter Rams
Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.	Howard H. Aiken
Good design is finding a solution to a problem. Great design is finding the simplest solution to the same problem.	Nicholas Peterson
If you have the courage to begin, you have the courage to succeed.	David Viscott
The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to give it away.	David Viscott
Try not to work for stupid people or you’ll soon become one of them.	John Jay
The truth is much less comforting: Each company is completely distinct and there is no playbook.	Sarah Lacy
Data beats emotions.	Sean Rad
Our overnight success took 1000 days.	Brian Chesky
“Build it and they will come,” is not a strategy; it’s a prayer.	Steve Blank
There are no facts inside the building so get the hell outside.	Steve Blank
You don’t have to be the smartest person, but showing up is 80% of the game.	Steve Blank
In a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.	Steve Blank
Success is predicated on too many factors for one methodology to guarantee that any single startup will be a winner. But on the basis of what I’ve seen at hundreds of startups, at programs that teach lean principles, and at established companies that practice them, I can make a more important claim: Using lean methods across a portfolio of startups will result in fewer failures than using traditional methods.	Steve Blank
After you’ve raised money, shut up, put your slides away, stop selling, and start listening to your customers.	Steve Blank
Disruption on the first day always looks like a toy…	Steve Blank
Building a successful business model isn’t about changing your company based on every bit of feedback: It’s about understanding whom to listen to and why.	Steve Blank
Don’t confuse “raising money” with “building a sustainable business.” In a perfect world, you would never need investors and would fund the company from customer revenue. But to achieve scale, startups need risk capital. Raise as much money as you can after you have tangible evidence you have product/market fit, not before.	Steve Blank
At the end of the day, you can decide whether you want to be an employee with a great attendance record, getting promoted to ever better titles and working on interesting projects – or whether you want to attempt to do something spectacular – this be or do should be a question you never stop asking yourself — for the next 20 years, and beyond.	Steve Blank
Startups are painful, stressful and at times demoralizing. You need to be a true believer in the vision of what you are doing. You need to be passionate about it and love what you’re doing	Steve Blank
I was worth about over a million dollars when I was 23 and over ten million dollars when I was 24, and over a hundred million dollars when I was 25 and… it wasn’t that important — because I never did it for the money.	Steve Jobs
To turn really interesting ideas and fledgling technologies into a company that can continue to innovate for years, it requires a lot of disciplines.	Steve Jobs
It’s not a faith in technology. It’s faith in people.	Steve Jobs
Our goal is to make the best devices in the world, not to be the biggest.	Steve Jobs
Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works.	Steve Jobs
Technology is nothing. What’s important is that you have a faith in people, that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.	Steve Jobs
My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.	Steve Jobs
It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.	Steve Jobs
I think we’re having fun. I think our customers really like our products. And we’re always trying to do better.	Steve Jobs
It’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy.	Steve Jobs
Every good product I’ve ever seen is because a group of people cared deeply about making something wonderful that they and their friends wanted. They wanted to use it themselves.	Steve Jobs
The hardest thing when you think about focusing. You think focusing is about saying “Yes.” No. Focusing is about saying “No.” And when you say “No,” you piss off people.	Steve Jobs
If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will.	Steve Jobs
I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much.	Steve Jobs
I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on.	Steve Jobs
People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.	Steve Jobs
My job is to say when something sucks rather than sugarcoat it.	Steve Jobs
If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away.	Steve Jobs
My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That’s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they’re done by a team of people.	Steve Jobs
Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.	Steve Jobs
Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.	Steve Jobs
Quality is much better than quantity. One home run is much better than two doubles	Steve Jobs
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.	Steve Jobs
Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.	Steve Jobs
Let’s go invent tomorrow instead of worrying about what happened yesterday.	Steve Jobs
If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.	Steve Jobs
But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we’ve been thinking about a problem.	Steve Jobs
We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?	Steve Jobs
Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.	Steve Jobs
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary	Steve Jobs
If you keep your eye on the profit, you’re going to skimp on the product. But if you focus on making really great products, then the profits will follow.	Steve Jobs
Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith.	Steve Jobs
If you don’t love something, you’re not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much.	Steve Jobs
That’s been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.	Steve Jobs
Details matter, it’s worth waiting to get it right.	Steve Jobs
You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.	Steve Jobs
Things don’t have to change the world to be important.	Steve Jobs
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.	Steve Jobs
Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say: “I didn’t quit.”	Ben Horowitz
When things go wrong in your company, nobody cares. The press doesn’t care, your investors don’t care, your board doesn’t care, your employees don’t care, even your mama doesn’t care. Nobody cares… Just run your company.	Ben Horowitz
Focus on the road not the wall.	Ben Horowitz
Tip to aspiring entrepreneurs: if you don’t like choosing between horrible and cataclysmic, don’t become CEO.	Ben Horowitz
The only thing that prepares you to run a company is running a company.	Ben Horowitz
Generally, someone doesn’t become CEOs unless she has a high sense of purpose and cares deeply about the work she does. In addition, a CEO must be accomplished enough or smart enough that people will want to work for her.	Ben Horowitz
I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.	Warren Buffett
Intensity is the price of excellence.	Warren Buffett
Go for a business that any idiot can run – because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it.	Peter Lynch
When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem.	Buckminster Fuller
If you want to conquer fear, don’t sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.	Dale Carnegie
At the end of the day you still have to make something people want. You have find a way to produce it. You have to find a way to distribute it.	Travis Kalanick
When something’s fun, it’s obvious: That’s when you just need to do more of it.	Travis Kalanick
In a lot of ways, it’s not the money that allows you to do new things. It’s the growth and the ability to find things that people want and to use your creativity to target those.	Travis Kalanick
As an entrepreneur, I try to push the limits. Pedal to the metal.	Travis Kalanick
My politics are: I’m a trustbuster. Very focused. And yeah, I’m pro-efficiency. I want the most economic activity at the lowest price possible. It’s good for everybody; it’s not red or blue.	Travis Kalanick
The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.	Ayn Rand
Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him, and to let him know that you trust him.	Booker T. Washington
You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don’t try.	Beverly Sills
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.	Confucius
You can’t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.	Maya Angelou
What’s money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.	Bob Dylan
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.	Robert Frost
Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.	George Addair
Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.	Teddy Roosevelt
There is only one way to avoid criticism: Do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.	Aristotle
I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.	Maya Angelou
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.	Stephen Covey
Rarely have I seen a situation where doing less than the other guy is a good strategy.	Jimmy Spithill
If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else.	Booker T. Washington
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.	Joshua Marine
You can’t fall if you don’t climb. But there’s no joy in living your whole life on the ground.	Unknown

In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.	Dwight D. Eisenhower
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.	Agatha Christie
I treat business a bit like a computer game. I count money as points. I’m doing really well: making lots of money and lots of points.	Michael Dunlop
After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts.	Aristotle
A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business.	Henry Ford
The greatest reward in becoming a millionaire is not the amount of money that you earn. It is the kind of person that you have to become to become a millionaire in the first place.	Jim Rohn

By working faithfully eight hours a day you may eventually get to be boss and work twelve hours a day.	Robert Frost

There’s so much to learn about business and how it works, its impacts and potential, so it’s a fascinating field to study. I see entrepreneurship as the most exciting career path. It’s limitless – financially, intellectually, and socially.	Emil Motycka
I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.	George Burns
The biggest failure you can have in life is not trying at all.	Emil Motycka
I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.	Thomas Edison

Entrepreneurs are selected to be just doers, not thinkers, and doers do, they don’t talk.	Nicholas Nassim Taleb
He who begins many things finishes but few	Proverb
You need to ask yourself, ‘Where do you want to work: startups, mid-size or large companies?’ …If you find yourself debating the ‘startup versus large company’ choice you’ve already chosen the big company. Entrepreneurship isn’t a career choice it’s a passion and obsession.	Steve Blank
Revolutions are not obvious when they happen. When James Watt started the industrial revolution with the steam engine in 1775 no one said, ‘Today, everything changes.’ When Karl Benz drove around Mannheim in 1885, no one said, ‘There will be 500 million of these driving around in a century.’ And certainly in 1958 when Noyce and Kilby invented the integrated circuit, the idea of a quintillion (10 to the 18th power) transistors being produced each year seemed ludicrous.	Steve Blank
If the opportunity is so large, and the barriers to starting up so low, why haven’t the number of scalable startups exploded exponentially? What’s holding us back? While it’s easier than ever to draw an idea on the back of the napkin, build a prototype or create a small business on the side, it’s still hard to quit your day job and commit ‘all in.’	Steve Blank
Startups are painful, stressful and at times demoralizing. You need to be a true believer in the vision of what you are doing. You need to passionate about it and love what you’re doing. If you don’t, there is no way you can sustain the hours, stress and disappointment. There’s no way you’re going to be able to convince investors, customers and most importantly recruit a world-class team if you not building something you think is going to change the world.	Steve Blank
Business plans are the tool existing companies use for execution. They are the wrong tool to search for a business model.	Steve Blank
A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.	Steve Blank
For truly visionary founders ‘seeing things that could be’ means more than just a standalone product—it means a world transformed.	Steve Blank
A startup is not about executing a series of knowns. Most startups are facing a series of unknowns—unknown customer segments, unknown customer needs, unknown product feature set, etc.	Steve Blank
…some small segment of founders are truly artists—they see something no one else does. These entrepreneurs are the ones who want to change ‘what is’ and turn it into ‘what can be.’ These founders create new ideas and new markets by pushing the boundaries. This concept of creating something that few others see—and the reality distortion field necessary to recruit the team to build it—is at the heart of what these founders do.	Steve Blank
What matters is having forward momentum and a tight fact-based data/metrics feedback loop to help you quickly recognize and reverse any incorrect decisions. That’s why startups are agile. By the time a big company gets the committee to organize the subcommittee to pick a meeting date, your startup could have made 20 decisions, reversed five of them and implemented the fifteen that worked.	Steve Blank
The company that consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often decisive, competitive advantage.	Steve Blank
No business plan survives first contact with a customer.	Steve Blank
Don’t compromise.	Steve Jobs
Raise brands as you’d raise a child.	Tiffany Sauder
If you want to change the world, you don’t need to open a factory. You just need to open a laptop.	Alexis Ohanian
You should take as much time as possible to make your product perfect.	Shana Fisher
Willingness to be misunderstood is one of our greatest strengths.	Jeff Bezos
Once you have a core product, the goals should be growth, monetization, and happiness.	Brian Watsons
The best products are “simple, but perfect.” Make it quick, easy, and delightful for your customers.	Brian Watsons
There are many approaches to product management. Some companies start with design and move to engineering; others write a “press release” and then build the product; others brainstorm and prioritize. Do what feels right for your organization.	Brian Watsons
Don’t be afraid to share your important stats with your users.	Brian Watsons
Constraints lead to creativity. You’re most creative in 140 characters and when your company is running out of runway.	Brian Watsons
Kill features. Edit. Remove an old feature for each one you add.	Brian Watsons
All VCs have low attention spans. Use no more than 10-15 slides in a partnership meeting.	Brian Watsons
Raising money is a trade-off between valuation and control.	Brian Watsons
Being selective — doing less—keeps you focused.	Brian Watsons
Research in public. Open-source your ideas, and let the world help you build them.	Brian Watsons
Don’t be afraid to respectfully say no to things. You shouldn’t waste someone’s time if you’re not the right fit for each other.	Brian Watsons
Aspirations can’t be measured; goals can. Theoretically, aspirations lead to goals. Set them, and track against them.	Brian Watsons
Being a successful VC is as simple as having the conviction to believe in something when everyone else doesn’t. You have to be right when everyone is wrong.	Brian Watsons
If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.	Bre Pettis
Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.	Bre Pettis
People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.	Bre Pettis
Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.	Bre Pettis
Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.	Bre Pettis
Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.	Bre Pettis
Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.	Bre Pettis
There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.	Bre Pettis
You may not be a Picasso or Mozart but you don’t have to be. Just create to create. Create to remind yourself you’re still alive. Make stuff to inspire others to make something too. Create to learn a bit more about yourself.	Frederic Terral
When you’re a one man show, you have to focus on the most important thing to get done today.	Noah Everett
There is no luck, you work hard and study things intently. If you do that for long and hard enough you’re successful.	Jason Calacanis
Trust your instincts.	Estée Lauder
The first rule of organizational design is that all organizational designs are bad.	Ben Horowitz
Losing is just a step on the path toward winning	Unknown
Innovation is almost insane by definition: most people view any truly innovative idea as stupid, because if it was a good idea, somebody would have already done it.	Success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day.	Jim Rohn
The technology business is fundamentally the innovation business. Etymologically, the word technology means “a better way of doing things.” As a result, innovation is the core competency for technology companies. Technology companies are born because they create a better way of doing things. Eventually, someone else will come up with a better way. Therefore, if a technology company ceases to innovate, it will die.	Ben Horowitz
In the beginning, the focus of a startup must be on building a great product and finding product market fit. During this period, there is no glamour and very little breadth—the company must be narrow.	Ben Horowitz
In order to build a great technology company, you have to hire lots of incredibly smart people.	Ben Horowitz
My single biggest personal improvement as CEO occurred on the day when I stopped being too positive.	Ben Horowitz
The top two priorities are always to: 1)Find the product that 1,000 enterprise or 50 million consumers want to buy and grab those customers before your competitors do. 2) Raise enough cash and spend it intelligently so that you don’t go broke along the way.	Ben Horowitz
There are only two priorities for a start-up: winning the market and not running out of cash. Running lean is not an end.	Ben Horowitz
What makes people want to follow a leader: 1) The ability to articulate the vision. 2) The right kind of ambition. 3) The ability to achieve the vision.	Ben Horowitz
Truly great leaders create an environment where the employees feel that the CEO cares much more about the employees than she cares about herself. In this kind of environment, an amazing thing happens: a huge number of the employees believe that it’s their company and behave accordingly.	Ben Horowitz
You have achieved excellence as a leader when people will follow you anywhere if only out of curiosity.	Colin Powell
Planning is valuable, though the plan is usually useless.	Ben Horowitz
The only surefire antidote to capital market climate change is positive cash flow. If you generate cash, investors mean nothing. If you do not, then your success will depend upon the kindness of strangers.	Ben Horowitz
If investors wake up one day & think you are toast, you are indeed toast.	Ben Horowitz
As a startup CEO, I slept like a baby. I woke up every 2 hours and cried.	Ben Horowitz
The technology startup world is where brilliant people come to imagine the impossible.	Ben Horowitz
I follow the principle of the Bushido – the way of the warrior: keep death in mind at all times. If a warrior keeps death in mind at all times and lives as though each day might be his last, he will conduct himself properly in all his actions.	Ben Horowitz
A manager can’t act like a role model. They need to BE a role model.	Ben Horowitz
The trouble with innovation is that truly innovative ideas often look like bad ideas at the time.	Ben Horowitz
Think for yourself and go build it.	Ben Horowitz
Some employees make products, some make sales; the CEO makes decisions.	Ben Horowitz
“We take care of the people, the products, and the profits — in that order.” It’s a simple saying, but it’s deep. “Taking care of the people” is the most difficult of the three by far and if you don’t do it, the other two won’t matter. Taking care of the people means that your company is a good place to work.	Ben Horowitz
Too often the investment in people stops there.	Ben Horowitz
If you run a company, you will experience overwhelming psychological pressure to be overly positive. Stand up to the pressure, face your fear, and tell it like it is.	Ben Horowitz
Remember that this is what separates the women from the girls. If you want to be great, this is the challenge. If you don’t want to be great, then you never should have started a company.	Ben Horowitz
Spend zero time on what you could have done, and devote all of your time on what you might do. Because in the end, nobody cares; just run your company.	Ben Horowitz
Once you begin your process, keep in mind that you are looking for a market of one. You don’t need every investor to believe that you can succeed. You only need one. If 20 investors tell you “no,” that does not mean that there is no market for your deal. You just need one to say yes, and she will erase all 20 no’s.	Ben Horowitz
One of the great things about building a tech company is the amazing people that you can hire.	Ben Horowitz
An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to a single person who can delay the entire project.	Ben Horowitz
There are no shortcuts to knowledge, especially knowledge gained from personal experience. Following conventional wisdom and relying on shortcuts can be worse than knowing nothing at all.	Ben Horowitz
Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.	Frank Borman
Ideas are easy. It’s the execution of ideas that really separates the sheep from the goats.	Sue Grafton
Nobody is born knowing how to be a CEO – it’s a learned skill and unfortunately you learn it on the job.	Ben Horowitz
When it comes to business success, it is all about people, people, people. When it comes to developing successful people, it is all about fun, fun, fun!	Richard Branson
Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing.	Warren Buffett
When you hire someone, ask how they are going to push the company forward. Because companies don’t do things, people do things.	Tom Preston-Werner
A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.	Tom Preston-Werner
The time to start iterating the product is if, and only if, sufficient customers tell you your problem hypotheses are incorrect or point out features you missed that would cause them not to buy.	Steve Blank
In a startup the role of Customer Development is to: test the founders hypothesis about the customer problem; test if the product concept and minimum feature set solve that problem.	Steve Blank
Success is when reality looks like what’s in our imagination.	Simon Sinek
Not sitting on a large pool of capital keeps you scared as $@#! ― which makes you hungrier, more creative and more resourceful.	Jeremy Smith
The best time to raise capital is once you have worked out a lot of the issues and you can easily say, ‘If you invest X, I can turn it into Y.’	Rachael Qualls
Get out there, make some mistakes, learn from them…. And win	Ben Wiener
It’s fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.	Bill Gates
If you’re going to put your product in beta – put your business model in beta with it.	Joe Kraus
Wonder what your customer really wants? Ask. Don’t tell.	Lisa Stone
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.	Steve Jobs
Theory is splendid but until put into practice, it is valueless.	James Cash Penney
You just have to pay attention to what people need and what has not been done.	Russell Simmons
You don’t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing and falling over.	Richard Branson
Always deliver more than expected.	Larry Page
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.	Walt Disney
Risk more than others think is safe. Dream more than others think is practical.	Howard Schultz
Fearlessness is like a muscle. I know from my own life that the more I exercise it the more natural it becomes to not let my fears run me.	Arianna Huffington
I don’t look to jump over 7-foot bars — I look for 1-foot bars that I can step over.	Warren Buffett
All humans are entrepreneurs not because they should start companies but because the will to create is encoded in human DNA.	Reid Hoffman
I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying.	Jeff Bezos
Don’t worry about funding if you don’t need it. Today it’s cheaper to start a business than ever.	Noah Everett
It’s more effective to do something valuable than to hope a logo or name will say it for you.	Jason Cohen
You can’t make anything viral, but you can make something good.	Peter Shankman
I try not to make any decisions that I’m not excited about.	Jake Nickel
When I’m old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say ‘wow, that was an adventure,’ not ‘wow, I sure felt safe.’	Tom Preston-Werner
The only thing worse than starting something and failing… is not starting something.	Seth Godin
Stay self-funded as long as possible.	Garrett Camp
Every day that we spent not improving our products was a wasted day.	Joel Spolsky
Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard.	Guy Kawasaki

If you’re interested in the living heart of what you do, focus on building things rather than talking about them.	Ryan Freitas
Don’t try to be original, just try to be good.	Paul Rand
Nothing works better than just improving your product.	Joel Spolsky
If there’s something you want to build, but the tech isn’t there yet, just find the closest possible way to make it happen.	Dennis Crowley
Get five or six of your smartest friends in a room and ask them to rate your idea.	Mark Pincus
There’s nothing wrong with staying small. You can do big things with a small team.	Jason Fried
It’s not about ideas. It’s about making ideas happen.	Scott Belsky
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.	Steve Jobs
Chase the vision, not the money, the money will end up following you.	Tony Hsieh
Your reputation is more important than your paycheck, and your integrity is worth more than your career.	Ryan Freitas
Selling to people who actually want to hear from you is more effective than interrupting strangers who don’t.	Seth Godin
The ability to change fast is the single most important asset in a world that’s changing fast.	Seth Godin
Passion isn’t project-specific. It’s people-specific.	Seth Godin
The scalable, profitable strategy is to change the game, not to become the most average.	Seth Godin
Don’t have any meetings about your web strategy. Just do stuff. First you have to fail, then you can improve.	Seth Godin
If there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do work that matters, this is it.	Seth Godin
Successful people are the ones who are breaking the rules.	Seth Godin
If you make a difference, people will gravitate to you. They want to engage, to interact and to get you more involved.	Seth Godin
Big ideas are little ideas that no-one killed too soon.	Seth Godin
You can’t have good ideas unless you’re willing to generate a lot of bad ones.	Seth Godin
If there isn’t a good reason, go home. If there is, then do something … loud, now, and memorable.	Seth Godin
Becoming a superstar takes about 10,000 hours of hard work.	Seth Godin
Change is not a threat, it’s an opportunity. Survival is not the goal, transformative success is.	Seth Godin
Knowing what to do is very, very different than actually doing it.	Seth Godin
If you want to dig a big hole, you need to stay in one place.	Seth Godin
The best time to do great customer service is when a customer is upset.	Seth Godin
Playing safe is very risky.	Seth Godin
One way to think about running a successful business is to figure out what the least you can do is, and do that.	Seth Godin
Everyone is not your customer.	Seth Godin
Ideas in secret die. They need light and air or they starve to death.	Seth Godin
Go ahead, do something impossible.	Seth Godin
Are you a serial idea-starting person? The goal is to be an idea-shipping person.	Seth Godin
People don’t want to change their worldview. They like it, they embrace it and they want it to be reinforced.	Seth Godin
Stop advertising and start innovating.	Seth Godin
I don’t think there’s a shortage of remarkable ideas. I think your business has plenty of great opportunities to do great things. Nope, what’s missing isn’t the ideas. It’s the will to execute them.	Seth Godin
Don’t try to make a product for everybody, because that is a product for nobody.	Seth Godin
The people who are the best in the world specialize at getting really good at the questions they don’t know.	Seth Godin
If you are deliberately trying to create a future that feels safe, you will willfully ignore the future that is likely.	Seth Godin
Instead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don’t need to escape from.	Seth Godin
Imagine that the world had no middlemen, no publishers, no bosses, no HR folks, no one telling you what you couldn’t do. If you lived in that world, what would you do? Go. Do that.	Seth Godin
You are not your resume, you are your work.	Seth Godin
Make a decision. It doesn’t have to be a wise decision or a perfect one. Just make one.	Seth Godin
Hard work is about risk. It begins when you deal with the things that you’d rather not deal with: fear of failure, fear of standing out, fear of rejection. Hard work is about training yourself to leap over this barrier, tunnel under that barrier, drive through the other barrier. And after you’ve done that, to do it again the next day.	Seth Godin
You have everything you need to build something far bigger than yourself.	Seth Godin
The cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing.	Seth Godin
A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.	Peter Thiel
It’s a really good time to be an entrepreneur. If you have a halfway decent idea, you can get it completely funded.	Peter Thiel
There is perhaps no specific time that is necessarily right to start your company or start your life. But some times and some moments seem more auspicious than others. Now is such a moment. If we don’t take charge and usher in the future—if you don’t take charge of your life—there is the sense that no one else will.	Peter Thiel
Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.	Vince Lombardi
It seems like we’ve not been thinking about the right issues for a long time. I actually think it is a big step just to ask the question “What does one need to do to make the U.S. a better place?”	Peter Thiel
As an investor-entrepreneur, I’ve always tried to be contrarian, to go against the crowd, to identify opportunities in places where people are not looking.	Peter Thiel
‘There are still many large white spaces on the map of human knowledge. You can go discover them. So do it. Get out there and fill in the blank spaces. Every single moment is a possibility to go to these new places and explore them.	Peter Thiel
Your mind is software. Program it. Your body is a shell. Change it. Death is a disease. Cure it. Extinction is approaching. Fight it.	Peter Thiel
We’re trying to build a sustainable company that’s here for the next 100 years.	Jan Koum
A lot of times, people start out with a lot of good ideas, but then they don’t execute. They lose the purity of their vision. You end up running around in circles.	Jan Koum
Anybody can build a company and sell the company the next day. That doesn’t make you special, it doesn’t make you unique, it doesn’t make you all that great.	Jan Koum
Customer service shouldn’t be a department. It should be the entire company.	Tony Hsieh
The best way to complain is to make things.	James Murphy
You don’t have to hold a position in order to be a leader.	Henry Ford
The best thing about building things is that they’re never used exactly how you expect them to be.	Danielle Morrill
Don’t let people tell you your ideas are stupid. If you’re really passionate about something, find a way to build it.	Dennis Crowley
The trick isn’t adding stuff, it’s taking away.	Mark Zuckerberg
The demands and the amount of work that it takes to put something like [Facebook] into place, it’s just so much that if you weren’t completely into what you were doing and you didn’t think it was an important thing, then it would be irrational to spend that much time on it.	Mark Zuckerberg
Companies getting started now that are just trying to copy what other people are doing aren’t successful.	Mark Zuckerberg
One of the lessons is…do something fundamental. A lot of companies I see are operating on small problems, and that’s fine if you want to be an entrepreneur, but the most interesting things operate on a fundamental level.	Mark Zuckerberg
Serving more people, increasing your customer base and making them more deeply engaged is by itself good business.	Mark Zuckerberg
Done is better than perfect.	Mark Zuckerberg
Move fast and break things.	Mark Zuckerberg
I have this fear of getting locked into doing things that are not the most impactful things you can do.	Mark Zuckerberg
Simply put: we don’t build services to make money; we make money to build better services. And we think this is a good way to build something.	Mark Zuckerberg
My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There’s a lot of that in Silicon Valley.	Mark Zuckerberg
I believe that over time, people get remembered for what they build, and if you build something great, people don’t care about what someone says about you in a movie…	Mark Zuckerberg
We look for people who are passionate about something. In a way, it almost doesn’t matter what you’re passionate about. What we really look for when we’re interviewing people is what they’ve shown an initiative to do on their own.	Mark Zuckerberg
I think as a company, if you can get those two things right — having a clear direction on what you are trying to do and bringing in great people who can execute on the stuff — then you can do pretty well.	Mark Zuckerberg
There’s a hacker mantra that you’ll hear a lot around Facebook offices: ‘Code wins arguments.’	Mark Zuckerberg
The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it — often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo…	Mark Zuckerberg
I’m here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.	Mark Zuckerberg
The question I ask myself like almost every day is, ‘Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?’… Unless I feel like I’m working on the most important problem that I can help with, then I’m not going to feel good about how I’m spending my time. And that’s what this company is.	Mark Zuckerberg
Find that thing you are super passionate about. A lot of founding principles of Facebook are that if people have access to more information and are more connected, it will make the world better; people will have more understanding, more empathy. That’s the guiding principle for me. On hard days, I really just step back, and that’s the thing that keeps me going.	Mark Zuckerberg
People can be really smart or have skills that are directly applicable, but if they don’t really believe in it, then they are not going to really work hard.	Mark Zuckerberg
All of my friends who have younger siblings who are going to college or high school – my number one piece of advice is: You should learn how to program.	Mark Zuckerberg
In terms of doing work and in terms of learning and evolving as a person, you just grow more when you get more people’s perspectives… I really try and live the mission of the company and… keep everything else in my life extremely simple.	Mark Zuckerberg
My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that, as if I don’t care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that – building something that actually makes a really big change in the world.	Mark Zuckerberg
Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.	Mark Zuckerberg
The companies that work are the ones that people really care about and have a vision for the world so do something you like.	Mark Zuckerberg
The real story of Facebook is just that we’ve worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.	Mark Zuckerberg
I think a simple rule of business is, if you do the things that are easier first, then you can actually make a lot of progress.	Mark Zuckerberg
Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission – to make the world more open and connected.	Mark Zuckerberg
It’s hard to keep things moving. And that’s always a big trick. I think for me, the key is setting really big goals.	Larry Page
If you have a product that’s really gaining a lot of usage, then it’s probably a good idea.	Larry Page
You don’t need to have a 100-person company to develop that idea.	Larry Page
You never lose a dream. It just incubates as a hobby.	Larry Page
I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name.	Larry Page
Always work hard on something uncomfortably exciting.	Larry Page
It’s important that the company be a family, that people feel that they’re part of the company, and that the company is like a family to them. When you treat people that way, you get better productivity.	Larry Page
My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they’re having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society.	Larry Page
I would rather have people think we’re confused than let our competitors know what we’re going to do.	Larry Page
You need to invent things and you need to get them to people. You need to commercialize those inventions. Obviously, the best way we’ve come up with doing that is through companies.	Larry Page
I think part of the reason we’re successful so far is that originally we didn’t really want to start a business.	Larry Page
Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.	Larry Page
Lots of companies don’t succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future.	Larry Page
We don’t have as many managers as we should, but we would rather have too few than too many.	Larry Page
Many leaders of big organizations, I think, don’t believe that change is possible. But if you look at history, things do change, and if your business is static, you’re likely to have issues.	Larry Page
If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach.	Larry Page
Know the philosophy, know the details, and ignore everything in the middle.	Gary Vaynerchuk
“Toothbrush test”: new products must be important enough that people will use them at least twice a day.	How to get business ideas: 1. Find a job people have. 2. List out every step people take to complete that job. 3. Remove as many steps as you can.	Nathan Kontny
Everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness and growth occurs while you’re climbing it.	Andy Rooney
There is only one boss: the customer. And he can fire everybody in the company, from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.	Sam Walton
Whatever you’re thinking, think bigger.	Tony Hsieh
You have to have more leadership, less management. It’s about getting stuff done, you can sit around and analyze things forever but while you do that the competition has moved on.	Peter Vesterbacka
I never took a day off in my twenties. Not one.	Bill Gates
We’re not very good at knowing what we want, and we are very quick to say, ‘This sucks.’ That’s where the opportunity lies.	Gary Vaynerchuk
I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.	Steve Jobs
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.	Thomas Edison
The most dangerous poison is the feeling of achievement. The antidote is to every evening think what can be done better tomorrow.	Ingvar Kamprad
Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.	Henry Ford
Ideas are a commodity. Execution of them is not.	Michael Dell
Timing, perseverance, and ten years of trying will eventually make you look like an overnight success.	Biz Stone
It’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower.	Paul Graham
Waiting for perfect is never as smart as making progress.	Seth Godin
Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful, that’s what matters to me.	Steve Jobs
If other people are putting in 40-hour workweeks, and you’re putting in 100-hour workweeks, then, even if you’re doing the same thing, you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve.	Elon Musk
Real artists ship.	Steve Jobs
Usage is like oxygen for ideas.	Matt Mullenweg
One of the metaphors that I use for startups is you throw yourself off a cliff and assemble an airplane on the way down. And part of that is the urgency of what you are doing, and it’s the focus on the work. But sometimes you have to be very creative; you have to be very nimble and agile in terms of how you do it.	Reid Hoffman
Life is a team sport. And, as much as entrepreneurs look like individuals who explore the desert by themselves in order to find riches, they are actually successful based upon their ability to find, build, connect, and collaborate with important networks.	Reid Hoffman
Whatever the situation, actions, not plans, generate lessons that help you test your hypotheses against reality.	Reid Hoffman
The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be.	Reid Hoffman
When you’re doing work you care about, you are able to work harder and better.	Reid Hoffman
A lot of people seem to think that behind every great start-up is a single entrepreneur with an idea. The reality is, great companies are built by a number of people with talent who are surrounded by supportive networks.	Reid Hoffman
Part of your identity is saying not only what you will be but also what you won’t.	Reid Hoffman
Rules of entrepreneurship are guidelines, not laws of nature.	Reid Hoffman
If you don’t start out aiming for the big game, you almost never can get there.	Reid Hoffman
So what you need is…people who are creative. You need people who are truth seeking. And you need to have people who are very honest with each other, but also fun, hard working, and want to win.	Reid Hoffman
…the key things to shorten the [length of time for] getting to the market with a minimum viable product… I had learned from SocialNet and PayPal. As opposed to waiting for a perfect product, you actually want to be launching the minimum viable product, the thinnest possible product, and then you iterate and develop.	Reid Hoffman
Tackling those early hypotheses as soon as you can is extremely important.	Reid Hoffman
The actual winning strategy is “I’m moving, I’m getting out there and I’m adapting at a fast rate.”	Reid Hoffman
Don’t enter a crowded market.	Reid Hoffman
Pay attention to your culture and your hires from the very beginning.	Reid Hoffman
Having a great idea for a product is important, but having a great idea for product distribution is even more important.	Reid Hoffman
Good ideas need good strategy to realize their potential.	Reid Hoffman
A product needs to be sufficiently innovative to distinguish itself from the pack, but not so forward thinking as to alienate the user.	Reid Hoffman
Every Net entrepreneur should answer these questions: How do we get to one million users? Then how do we get to 10 million users? Then how will you get deep engagement by your users.	Reid Hoffman
In real estate the wisdom says “location, location, location.” In consumer Internet, think “distribution, distribution, distribution.”	Reid Hoffman
I lose interest when things don’t have scale.	Reid Hoffman
One thing I learned in ’97, when I thought the right time to found a company was during a swing-up, is that it’s much better to start during an economic downturn. Partnerships are easier; hiring is easier; and the competition starts later.	Reid Hoffman
A networker likes to meet people. I don’t. I like accomplishing things in the world. You meet people when you want to accomplish something.	Reid Hoffman
You have to be constantly reinventing yourself and investing in the future.	Reid Hoffman
I actually think every individual is now an entrepreneur, whether they recognize it or not.	Reid Hoffman
Silicon Valley is a mindset, not a location.	Reid Hoffman
And people who take risk intelligently can usually actually make a lot more progress than people who don’t.	Reid Hoffman
Love those close to you.Failure of your company is not failure in life. Failure in your relationships is.	Evan Williams
Take care of yourself. When you don’t sleep, eat crap, don’t exercise, and are living off adrenaline for too long, your performance suffers. Your decisions suffer. Your company suffers.	Evan Williams
Focus. Say no to most things: Features. People. Partnerships. “Coffees.” Projects. Only a few of them really matter. (Yes, it’s hard to know which.) Don’t get distracted.	Evan Williams
Take on big challenges. It’s pretty simple: Hard things are valuable; easy things are not so valuable. Reaching the mountaintop is rewarding because it is hard. If it was easy, everybody would do it.	Evan Williams
Work with amazing people. Don’t compromise on who you choose to found your company with and hire. Do not put up with ego-centric personalities or downer attitudes.	Evan Williams
Designing a product is keeping five thousand things in your brain and fitting them all together in new and different ways to get what you want. And every day you discover something new that is a new problem or a new opportunity to fit these things together a little differently. And it’s that process that is the magic.	Steve Jobs
Designing a product from scratch is always hard.	Evan Williams
Nothing clarifies focus like a date. (Or: If you don’t have a tough constraint, make one up.)	Evan Williams
Even if they’re awesome, having too big of a team will slow you down.	Evan Williams
Luck comes in many forms—and often looks bad at first.	Evan Williams
When you’re obsessing about one thing, you can reach insights about how to solve hard problems. If you have too many things to think about, you’ll get to the superficial solution, not the brilliant one.	Evan Williams
I think one of the things that kills great things so often is compromise—letting people talk you out of what your gut is telling you.	Evan Williams
User experience is everything. It always has been, but it’s still undervalued and under-invested in. If you don’t know user-centered design, study it. Hire people who know it. Obsess over it. Live and breathe it. Get your whole company on board.	Evan Williams
Be a user of your own product. Make it better based on your own desires. But don’t trick yourself into thinking you are your user.	Evan Williams
I was surprised by the success of something so simple. That’s a mantra for many people in the technology world—simplicity. But what we built wasn’t that amazing. It was the idea of putting a couple of things together and being able to establish a lead by doing something really, really simple. How far you can get on a simple idea is amazing… Simplicity is powerful.	Evan Williams
…realize that no sufficiently interesting space will be limited to one player. In a sense, competition actually is good—especially to legitimize new markets.	Evan Williams
If you want to build a billion-dollar internet company, take a human desire, preferably one that has been around for a really long time, identify that desire and use modern technology to take out steps.	Evan Williams
If you study what the really big things on the internet are, you realize they are masters at making things fast and not making people think.	Evan Williams
We often think of the internet enables you to do new things, but people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.	Evan Williams
Creativity comes from constraint.	Evan Williams
Our problem wasn’t that it blew up and was impossible to scale, but there were some bad choices made. One of the biggest lessons time after time was to focus. Do fewer things.	Evan Williams
Entrepreneur is someone who has a vision for something and a want to create.	David Karp
There are a lot of rich people in the world. There are very few people who have the privilege of getting to invent things that billions of people use.	David Karp
Where I feel the most productive and engaged is when I’m buried in code, buried in some project, tweaking some designs. I’m certainly introverted.	David Karp
Don’t be scared to try new things, but remember to hold on to the vision of your company and the initial successes that defined your brand.	Ryan Holmes
Hammer down product fundamentals first. Make sure you’ve got something that works before doubling down on promotion and marketing.	Ryan Holmes
Entrepreneurs, by disposition, are built to think big. When a role no longer affords those opportunities, it might be best to leave it in capable hands and move on.	Ryan Holmes
One of the primary failings of many new apps and tools is that they tend to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the user.	Ryan Holmes
I would rather die of passion than of boredom.	Vincent van Gogh
I promise you, a lot of it is luck. But you make your own luck by working really hard and trying lots and lots of things.	Kevin Systrom
Find a crew that loves what you’re doing.	Kevin Systrom
We were like ‘let’s focus on one thing’ – and that ended-up being photos.	Kevin Systrom
Nobody gets it right the first time, so fail quickly and fail often and learn from each of the steps in order to create a winning strategy.	Kevin Systrom
Create the minimum you can in order to test the hypothesis of whether your business will succeed or not. Polish, and bells & whistles are great, but if you focus on answering whether your fundamental assumptions are correct, you’ll be much better off in the long run.	Kevin Systrom
Start with solving a problem instead of having a technology and then searching for problems it might solve. When you create a problem driven business your roadmap dictates itself.	Kevin Systrom
The best companies come from people who focus on company building, not just product building.	Kevin Systrom
People don’t realize when you start a startup, you’re not just starting a product — you’re starting a company.	Kevin Systrom
I think it’s important to hear feedback, sometimes you just don’t need to listen to it.	Kevin Systrom
Far too many startups are technologies in search of a problem.	Kevin Systrom
It turns out when you make really nice stuff that people love, they will spread it to their friends because they’ll rave about it, they’ll tell people about it.	Kevin Systrom
Team building is one of the most important things when you get off the ground.	Kevin Systrom
I don’t think you should ever start a business and move in a direction where you can’t see it becoming a business.	Kevin Systrom
Fear…is the one thing that keeps people from doing the biggest things in the world.	Kevin Systrom
The problem with stealth startups is that you don’t get the feedback you need quickly enough.	Kevin Systrom
Stay away from this private beta stuff. Put it out there, find the people that are vocal about what you’re doing and put it in their hands and listen to them, listen to what they’re excited about.	Kevin Systrom
Don’t do too much, and cut away everything that doesn’t matter to the success of your product. Doing too much can create drag and hinder your ability to get things done.	Kevin Systrom
Great products and companies come from great teams.	Kevin Systrom
When you’re building a team, I don’t think it should be about filling head count. You shouldn’t say ‘I’m going to go out there and try to be a 50 person company or something.’	Kevin Systrom
Over time what you do is you simply take in data about what your users are doing and you focus on the stuff that people love the most.	Kevin Systrom
The lesson I’ve learned is that you need to make sure to always cut what doesn’t work, cut the stuff that isn’t popular, and focus on continually improving your product and your focus….	Kevin Systrom
I’m always in awe of people who are artists in their fields – people who understand that simply by taking ideas and translating them into reality, they’ve created value in the world.	Kevin Systrom
I think not focusing on money makes you sane because in the long run it can probably drive you crazy.	Kevin Systrom
Every startup should address a real and demonstrated need in the world. If you build a solution to a problem lots of people have, it’s so easy to sell your product to the world.	Kevin Systrom
Great products sell themselves.	Kevin Systrom
If you’ve got an idea, start today. There’s no better time than now to get going. That doesn’t mean quit your job and jump into your idea 100% from day one, but there’s always small progress that can be made to start the movement.	Kevin Systrom
We did what any entrepreneur would do, and we threw out everything that wasn’t working and kept what worked.	Kevin Systrom
It’s better to have fewer, better people. You’ll find that one amazing engineer can do the work of 5.	Kevin Systrom
The best feature is less features.	Kevin Systrom
The product is a proxy to the quality of the person. That’s why I care about the product but invest in the person.	Dan Martell
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.	Buckminster Fuller
ABCD = Always Be Customer Developing	Danielle Morrill
What we choose to do next, though, how to spend our resources or attention or effort, this is what defines us.	Seth Godin
Business isn’t about suits or stockholders. It’s about being true to yourself & your ideas.	Richard Branson
There are many core factors to making a company successful, and you have to continually refine and improve each one.	Craig Hanson
In trying to be all things to all customers, you can lose sight of the value of simplicity and speed. You need to focus more on the customer experience and ease of use, versus trying to give all of your customers everything they want.	Craig Hanson
If you are doing all the talking, you’re not getting a chance to learn, and you’re probably in the wrong room.	Craig Hanson
Listen three times as much as you speak.	Kirk Holland
The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.	Nolan Bushnell
Everyone who has ever taken a shower has had an idea. It’s the person who gets out of the shower, dries off, and does something about it that makes a difference.	Nolan Bushnell
It’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower.	Paul Graham
It isn’t enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.	Tim Ferriss
We led with our conviction rather than rational, because rational said it was impossible.	Daniel Ek
The hardest-working people don’t work hard because they’re disciplined. They work hard because working on an exciting problem is fun.	Drew Houston
You don’t need anyone’s approval and in fact, you probably won’t get it, so don’t even try	Kevin Rose
You shouldn’t look to someone else for validation. You have to really believe in yourself and know that, worst-case scenario, if it doesn’t work out, you still built something really cool.	Kevin Rose
Only work with those that have “a healthy disregard for the impossible,” and push everyone on your team until it’s uncomfortable.	Kevin Rose
A team aligned behind a vision will move mountains.	Kevin Rose
You always have to be looking for the next big thing.	Kevin Rose
If you believe in something, work nights and weekends. It won’t feel like work.	Kevin Rose
Don’t spend too much time planning, release early and often, some things will work, others won’t, refine and move forward and above all forget the money, just make sure you love what you’re doing.	Kevin Rose
The best ideas are the ones where everyone else thinks you’re crazy.	Kevin Rose
Your customers can’t design your product for you. People have a great sense of what’s making them unhappy right now, but they’re not very good at predicting what will make them happy in the future. That’s your job.	Phil Libin
Complaints are great; the more detailed, the better. They tell us where our product or overall experience is failing.	Phil Libin
Customer feedback is great for telling you what you did wrong. It’s terrible at telling you what you should do next.	Phil Libin
There are many wrong reasons to want to be an entrepreneur. I think there’s only one good reason: to change the world.	Phil Libin
Don’t expect fame and prestige either; with very few exceptions the life of an entrepreneur is humble.	Phil Libin
If you think that becoming an entrepreneur is a good way to make money, you’re just bad at math. Side note: you need to be pretty good at math to be a successful entrepreneur, so that’s already two strikes against you.	Phil Libin
Being an entrepreneur is much harder work than buying a lottery ticket.	Phil Libin
Almost every successful entrepreneur I know has had to fire a close friend at some point. This is probably the worst part of being an entrepreneur. The alternative is to never work with your friends in the first place, but that’s much, much worse.	Phil Libin
Don’t hire anyone unless you’re confident that you’ll be able to fire them.	Phil Libin
The most important thing to know about hiring people is how to fire people.	Phil Libin
Communication is the most important qualification for any position. Don’t hire anyone who you can’t completely understand, even if it’s for a very technical job.	Phil Libin
Hire people smarter than you	Phil Libin
When you’re 300 people, unless you’re very, very methodical, people have no idea what other people are working on. When you don’t know what your co-workers are working on that’s when you kind of start to lose respect for your co-workers and start to get cliques and different groups.	Phil Libin
Everything in the world can be made better, and everything in the world therefore should be made better. It deserves to be made better. It’s a moral obligation to try to improve things a little bit at a time.	Phil Libin
The third lesson that we finally applied to Evernote was, “Let’s make a product but let’s only make it for ourselves. That is the secret of happiness, it’s only working on stuff for yourself.”	Phil Libin
If you don’t make a product for yourself, it’s not actually that great.	Phil Libin
Consulting is like the worst existence in the universe. It’s just awful because you can make a lot of money but only while you’re working. The day you stop is the day that the money stops.	Phil Libin
Best advice I ever got was: Up-Up-Down-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right-B-A-Start.	Phil Libin
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.	Yoda
You must unlearn what you have learned.	Yoda
Wars not make one great.	Yoda
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night.	Yoda
If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are … a different game you should play.	Yoda
Much to learn you still have… my old padawan… This is just the beginning.	Yoda
The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side.	Yoda
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.	Yoda
Patience you must have my young padawan.	Yoda
If you end your training now — if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did — you will become an agent of evil.	Yoda
Don’t worry about failure, you only have to be right once.	Drew Houston
You have to get good at preparing yourself to understand what’s on the horizon.	Drew Houston
The fact is that there’s a problem with being first. When you do that, you create a market, and if you’re too early, you essentially leave the door open behind you for someone to do it better. I actually don’t think it matters how early or late you are as long as you hit critical mass.	Drew Houston
Everything can seem so mystifying before you start. But when you look behind the curtain at how some of these huge companies were built, it wasn’t a lot of magic. It’s people iteratively trying to make reasonable decisions and surround themselves with the smartest people they can.	Drew Houston
A lot of really great, innovative things have happened when people just didn’t know it wasn’t supposed to be possible.	Drew Houston
A lot of times it’s an asset to not know everything about everything. As you advance in your career, you feel like you know so much about the world and what’s possible. Then you have this mental model about how things work that gets less and less flexible. You can get stuck.	Drew Houston
If you start your own thing, you can learn a lot really fast from doing things wrong.	Drew Houston
Sometimes you just get this feeling — it’s a compulsion or an obsession. You can’t stop thinking about it. You just have to work on this thing. You need that hunger no matter what, because eventually the honeymoon period wears off. Somewhere between printing your business cards that say ‘founder’ on them and everything else you have to do, you realize, ‘Oh, actually this is a ton of work.’	Drew Houston
The problem we are solving is really hard. It took us many years to be able to build the product. You only discover these problems and how to solve them as you get more and more data on how people use it.	Drew Houston
Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems likes the problem is important enough to build a company on.	Paul Graham
I’ve seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you’re not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up.	Paul Graham
It’s not so important what you [high school students] work on, so long as you’re not wasting your time. Work on things that interest you and increase your options, and worry later about which you’ll take.	Paul Graham
Competitors punch you in the jaw, but investors have you by the balls.	Paul Graham
No matter what you work on, you’re not working on everything else. So the question is not how to avoid procrastination, but how to procrastinate well. There are three variants of procrastination, depending on what you do instead of working on something: you could work on (a) nothing, (b) something less important, or (c) something more important. That last type, I’d argue, is good procrastination.	Paul Graham
If you work on something you can finish in a day or two, you can expect to have a nice feeling of accomplishment fairly soon. If the reward is indefinitely far in the future, it seems less real.	Paul Graham
I think the way to “solve” the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list push you.	Paul Graham
The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you’re being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I’d feel like something was terribly wrong. … But the same alarms don’t go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I’m doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.	Paul Graham
Live in the future, then build what’s missing.	Paul Graham
Make something people want	Paul Graham
The most important quality in a CEO is his vision for the company’s future.	Paul Graham
In a sense there’s just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want.	Paul Graham
It’s better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.	Paul Graham
What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don’t do that, it won’t matter how clever your business model is.	Paul Graham
In the startup world, ‘not working’ is normal.	Paul Graham
For the most ambitious young people, the corporate ladder is obsolete.	Paul Graham
Like having a child, running a startup is the sort of experience that’s hard to imagine unless you’ve done it yourself.	Paul Graham
Users are a double-edged sword. They can help you improve your language, but they can also deter you from improving. So choose your users carefully, and be slow to grow their number. Having users is like optimization: the wise course is to delay it.	Paul Graham
Always produce.	Paul Graham
Don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.	Paul Graham
If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward.	Paul Graham
The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about.	Paul Graham
The most important thing is not to let fundraising get you down. Startups live or die on morale. If you let the difficulty of raising money destroy your morale, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.	Paul Graham
A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing : to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.	Paul Graham
I’m not saying there’s no such thing as genius. But if you’re trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.	Paul Graham
You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible.	Paul Graham
Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don’t win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.	Paul Graham
Your biggest challenge as an entrepreneur is not concealing your idea from others or keeping your idea a secret, it is actually convincing people that you’re not crazy and that you can pull it off.	Sean Parker
I suffer from this delusion that every product of my imagination is not only possible, but always on the cusp of becoming real.	Sean Parker
Part of the challenge of being an entrepreneur, if you’re going for a really huge opportunity, is trying to find problems that aren’t quite on the radar yet and try to solve those.	Sean Parker
You just keep pushing yourself harder and harder to achieve more and more – I don’t think it’s ever quite as glamorous as it appears on the outside.	Sean Parker
Solving specific problems is what drives me. I am not interested in having a career. I never have been.	Sean Parker
At the end of the day, money is just a proxy for votes. That is what makes politics so vulnerable to social media.	Sean Parker
Running a start-up is like eating glass. You just start to like the taste of your own blood.	Sean Parker

All businesses need to be young forever. If your customer base ages with you, you’re Woolworth’s.	Jeff Bezos
I strongly believe that missionaries make better products. They care more. For a missionary, it’s not just about the business.

If you never want to be criticized, for goodness’ sake don’t do anything new.	Jeff Bezos

It’s really complex to make something simple.	Jack Dorsey
You don’t have to start from scratch to do something interesting. You don’t have to start from scratch to have a massive impact on the world. You have to have a good idea. You have to convince other people of those good ideas. And you have to push as quickly as possible.	Jack Dorsey

Really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends. …Hardly anyone does that, and it’s incredibly helpful.	Elon Musk
I think the best way to attract venture capital is to try and come up with a demonstration of whatever product or service it is and ideally take that as far as you can. Just see if you can sell that to real customers and start generating some momentum. The further along you can get with that, the more likely you are to get funding.	Elon Musk
Work like hell.	Elon Musk

What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.	Jason Fried

The problem is that many entrepreneurs just start with their idea, but don’t state what their business hypothesis is and under what conditions they would abort their business idea.	Tech Cocktail
I think a pivot can’t be more than 90 degrees. It’s an adjustment, or a course correction, but only rarely a complete abandonment. You can pivot once, or maybe twice, but after that you’ve got a real problem. You’ve gone from a pivot to a twirl.	Howard A. Tullman
Before you start worrying about how to scale to 1000 customers you need to find one.	Brant Cooper
The big mistake that entrepreneurs make is that they just start pitching instead of listening.	Brant Cooper
To get started, break down your idea into testable elements. An effective experiment must clearly define these four elements: hypothesis, riskiest assumption, method, minimum criterion for success.	A common mistake I see many startup founders making is they aren’t solving a real problem…	Alexis Ohanian
We have to focus on the WHY before we can focus on the HOW and WHAT.	Techcrunch
Throughout my life I was never able to fully switch off and enjoy a concert, or a sports match. I would greatly respect their skill, but I could never avoid the thought that there were two types of people – the ones who were there doing it, and the ones who were watching. I didn’t want to spend even an hour just watching. I knew I could be the one doing it, and that’s how I wanted to spend my time.	Ivan Mazour
Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.	Tim O'Reilly
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.	Mark Twain
The scariest aspect in building a new product is that you have zero understanding of demand, until people give you money for the product. Asking a customer if they will buy an imaginary product never works.	Moment
When who we are and what we do are one and the same, we are walking the road of Must. When we make something because we Must, not just because we can, it is the difference between disposable products that last a few years and life-affirming movements that sustain generations. When we choose Must, what we create is ourselves. It is a body of work.	Elle Luna
The ubiquitous WD-40 lubricant got its name because the first 39 experiments failed. WD-40 literally stands for “Water Displacement–40th Attempt.” If they gave up early on like most of us do, we’d sure have a lot more squeaky hinges in the world	Fast Company
When you’re ready to quit, you’re closer than you think.	Bob Parsons
The very first company I started failed with a great bang. The second one failed a little bit less, but still failed. The third one, you know, proper failed, but it was kind of okay. I recovered quickly. Number four almost didn’t fail. It still didn’t really feel great, but it did okay. Number five was PayPal.	Max Levchin
Whether it’s space travel or a new startup, if you don’t try you never know what you can achieve.	Richard Branson
If you live for weekends or vacations, your shit is broken.	Gary Vaynerchuk
You can’t be in denial about whose fault it is. We entrepreneurs tend to think we’re the smartest guys in the room. When a business fails, almost always it’s our fault. Once you take the blame, you’ve already solved half the problem. When you learn failure isn’t fatal, you become less afraid of it.	Inc
The easiest way to go out of business is to be romantic about how you make your money.	Gary Vaynerchuk
Being busy is not the same as being productive. In fact, being busy is a form of laziness — lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.	Tim Ferriss
Start something small before you start something big. You can learn so much when the stakes are low that will apply to future projects. Test the business model with low risk using some of the tips/hacks we’ll teach. Iterate if there is potential or move on if not. But more important than anything else, is just to start. Take that first step–it’s the hardest. Once you realize your own potential, the sky is likely the limit!	Colin Grussing
If you have daily internal struggles with self doubt and indecision, you are almost certainly not going to achieve your mission, whatever it may be. I have found that, to a disturbing degree in this world, you have to believe your own hype to succeed.	Jeff Atwood
You could have a million ideas, but they’re all worthless if you don’t get them done	Lauren Amarante
Have a big vision, then make it 10x bigger. Having a compelling vision for where you want to take your business is important, but most first-time entrepreneurs think too small. I know I was guilty of this a few years ago. I can tell you now, whatever your vision is, it needs to be bigger and more compelling.	Mitchell Harper
No matter how brilliant your mind or strategy, if you’re playing a solo game, you’ll always lose out to a team.	Reid Hoffman
Make one thing great. Get one thing right. That earns you the right to go from product one to product two. Take as much time as you need to get product one right, and to prove it—because if you don’t, no one is going to be waiting on pins and needles for product two.	Andy Dunn
Passion is contagious. Humor is magic. And storytelling is an art.	Forbes

If you’ve got an idea, start today. There’s no better time than now to get going. That doesn’t mean quit your job and jump into your idea 100% from day one, but there’s always small progress that can be made to start the movement.	Kevin Systrom
If you are not embarrassed by the 1st version of your product, you’ve launched too late.	Reid Hoffman

Get shit done and get it done faster. There’s no point in going slow.	Steve Kaufer
The trickiest part about thinking big is you still need to think small at the same time while executing.	Gabriel Weinberg
Fun is more important than anything else. Focusing on anything other than your current situation means you’re planning on something that might not happen.	Sahil Lavingia
More companies die of indigestion than starvation.	David Packard
The #1 energy source for entrepreneurs is their passion for the business. It’s why 2 guys in a garage can compete against a fortune 500 company with unlimited resources.	Dan Martell
The only way to move forward is to take one step at a time.	Konosuke Matsushita
Learn by doing.	Vision without execution is just hallucination.	Henry Ford
