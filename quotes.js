{"quote":"I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It’s seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It’s seeing what other people don’t see and pursuing that vision.","author":"Howard Schultz"},
{"quote":"Early on I realized that I had to hire people smarter and more qualified than I was in a number of different fields, and I had to let go of a lot of decision-making.

{"quote":"It’s better to be in the arena, getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the stands or out in the parking lot.","author":"Steven Pressfield"},
{"quote":"This is the other secret that real artists know and wannabe writers don’t. When we sit down each day and do our work, power concentrates around us. The Muse takes note of our dedication. She approves. We have earned favor in her sight. When we sit down and work, we become like a magnetized rod that attracts iron filings. Ideas come. Insights accrete.","author":"Steven Pressfield"},

{"quote":"Question everything generally thought to be obvious.","author":"Dieter Rams"},

{"quote":"In a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.","author":"Steve Blank"},
{"quote":"Success is predicated on too many factors for one methodology to guarantee that any single startup will be a winner. But on the basis of what I’ve seen at hundreds of startups, at programs that teach lean principles, and at established companies that practice them, I can make a more important claim: Using lean methods across a portfolio of startups will result in fewer failures than using traditional methods.","author":"Steve Blank"},

{"quote":"Disruption on the first day always looks like a toy…","author":"Steve Blank"},
{"quote":"Building a successful business model isn’t about changing your company based on every bit of feedback: It’s about understanding whom to listen to and why.","author":"Steve Blank"},
{"quote":"Don’t confuse “raising money” with “building a sustainable business.” In a perfect world, you would never need investors and would fund the company from customer revenue. But to achieve scale, startups need risk capital. Raise as much money as you can after you have tangible evidence you have product/market fit, not before.","author":"Steve Blank"},
{"quote":"At the end of the day, you can decide whether you want to be an employee with a great attendance record, getting promoted to ever better titles and working on interesting projects – or whether you want to attempt to do something spectacular – this be or do should be a question you never stop asking yourself — for the next 20 years, and beyond.","author":"Steve Blank"},
{"quote":"Startups are painful, stressful and at times demoralizing. You need to be a true believer in the vision of what you are doing. You need to be passionate about it and love what you’re doing","author":"Steve Blank"},

{"quote":"My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.","author":"Steve Jobs"},

{"quote":"My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That’s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they’re done by a team of people.","author":"Steve Jobs"},

{"quote":"Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do.","author":"Steve Jobs"},
{"quote":"Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary","author":"Steve Jobs"},
